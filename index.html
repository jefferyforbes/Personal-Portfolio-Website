            <p class="short-p" id="A-Me">My passion for coding developed out of boredom during the nationwide lockdown in May 2020. It started as a new and fun skill that I could develop and create personal projects that I had thought of but never had the technical skills to do so.
                This led to the first project that I completed after one week of learning HTML and CSS; I created a business website for my step-dad. </p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" onclick="hideShowSection()" class="btn btn-secondary btn-lg ml-2 pb-2" id="hideShowBtn">Show "More About Me"</button>

        <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-12" id="learn-more-section"><br> The journey I am on right now started with that business website. Having dropped out of University (studied Law) due to a combination of losing interest in my Law degree and a feeling of losing time after my grandmother passed away. I decided
            that University was not the place for me. After one year, I still was not sure what I wanted to do and begun trying different things. I initially started to compete in some minor esports tournaments for Rainbow Six Siege; then I moved on to
            video-making on YouTube. And finally to streaming before finding a footing in coding. I have not and do not intend to stop participating in these activities that I started instead, I have shifted them to hobbies.
            <br> In fact, I still compete in more entertaining games for a discord community which we streamed for charity and managed to raise over Â£1200. Additionally, I occasionally make videos and stream on twitch. However, my primary focus is on
            programming.
